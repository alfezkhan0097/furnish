so you don't have to change anything.
to run the app open one terminal. open the folder where this file is interminal and run "npm run devs" but first check if you have the folder named: "node_modules" if not then run npm install. then run devs.

inside src>product>products.js it is the file which contains the whole data you can change add or edit data here it will reflect through whole app. 
cart items are stored in localstorage and will be there even if you turn the app off.
dont bother with app.jsx below are files arrangement

HomePage.jsx have Header,Hero,HeroWithPagination,List,Productsection,Showcase,Testimonial,TrendingSection.jsx

Shop.jsx and ProductPage.jsx are on seperate pages so is Cart and checkout.

when you present this app try to use the product with complete data or you add yourself. make sure images arent too high quality or loading time may wary.
